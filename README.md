# AI-in-Analog-Circuit-Design
In this project, the Ocean and Python Scripts are used to optimized the circuit in Analog IC Desin, including Genetic Algorithm, PSO, Advanced PSO. 
To implement these algorithms, users have to prepare EDA tools such as: Cadence Virtuoso, Synopsys HSPice, etc are built in Linux environemnt.
